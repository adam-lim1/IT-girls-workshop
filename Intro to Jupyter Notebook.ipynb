In other words: it's a single document where you can run code, display the output, and also add explanations, formulas, charts, and make your work more transparent, understandable, repeatable, and shareable. This is a notebook!"

    "- A <b>kernel</b> is a “computational engine” that executes the code contained in a notebook document.\n",
